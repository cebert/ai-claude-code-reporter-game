Ca# Sound Files for Reporter Game

Add the following audio files to this directory:

1. `background.mp3` - Background music during gameplay
2. `success.mp3` - Sound played when a report is fixed
3. `failure.mp3` - Sound played on game over
4. `level-up.mp3` - Sound played when advancing to a new level

The game will function without these files, but adding them will enhance the game experience.
