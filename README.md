# Report Fixer Game

A fun weekend experiment using Claude Code to implement a simple game where users click "stuck" reports to help them submit to the cloud to get a top score.

## About the Game

Report Fixer is a casual clicker game with a tech theme. You play as a data center engineer trying to fix stuck reports and help them upload to the AWS cloud. The faster you work, the higher your score!

## How to Play

1. Choose your character from the selection screen
2. Click on red "stuck" reports to fix them
3. Avoid clicking on green "good" reports - they will fly to the cloud automatically
4. Complete as many reports as possible before the timer runs out
5. Level up by fixing reports quickly

## Features

- Multiple playable characters with unique appearances
- Increasing difficulty levels
- Sound effects and background music
- Score tracking and AWS rank system
- Minecraft-inspired visual style

## Technical Details

This game was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. No frameworks or libraries were used. Audio support is optional - the game will function without sound files but will have enhanced experience with them.
